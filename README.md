## Project Title: 2dPokemongame

## Description:

A personal project combining Django (Python) for the backend, React (JavaScript) for the frontend, user authentication, third-party API integration, and a 2D game.

## Project Overview:

This project is structured into several phases to facilitate development and maintainability:

**Phase 1: Backend Development (Django)**

* Set up the Django project and app structure.
* Define the user model with appropriate attributes (username, password, etc.).
* Implement user authentication using the chosen method (Django built-in or third-party).
* Integrate with third-party APIs for their functionalities, including authentication and data retrieval.
* Develop API endpoints to manage user data and potentially provide game data.

**Phase 2: Frontend Development (React)**

* Set up the React project with necessary components for UI and functionality.
* Design a user-friendly interface for login, registration, and core functionalities.
* Connect to Django API endpoints for data fetching and interaction.
* Integrate third-party API functionalities within the frontend as required.

**Phase 3: 2D Game Development (Optional)**

* Select and integrate a 2D game engine library suitable for your game concept (e.g., Phaser, PixiJS).
* Develop the game logic, mechanics, and visuals with consideration for user interaction.
* Connect the game logic to the Django backend for data persistence (optional).

**Phase 4: Testing & Deployment**

* Implement unit and integration tests for both Django backend and React frontend to ensure code quality.
* Deploy the application to a suitable hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS) for accessibility.

## Technologies:

* Backend: Django (Python)
* Frontend: React (JavaScript)
* Authentication: (Specify chosen method)
* Third-party APIs: (List the APIs)
* 2D Game Engine: (Specify chosen library, if applicable)

## Setup Instructions:

**(Detailed instructions will be added once specific technologies are chosen)**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies (instructions will be tailored to chosen frameworks):

   ```bash
   cd <repo-name>
   # Replace with appropriate command (e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt)
   ```

3. Run database migrations (Django, if applicable):

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. Start the development server (commands will be adjusted based on frameworks):

   ```bash
   # Replace with appropriate command (e.g., python manage.py runserver)
   ```

## Usage:

* Access the application at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ (or the specified development URL).
* User registration and login functionalities will be available (if implemented).
